Hereâ€™s a **simple and clear project plan** for your to-do list app based on the requirements and constraints provided. The plan is divided into **main tasks** and **technical considerations** for both the backend and frontend.

---

## **Project Plan: To-Do List App**

### **1. Project Setup**
- **Task:** Initialize the project structure.
- **Technical Considerations:**
  - Create a root folder for the project.
  - Inside the root folder, create two subfolders: `backend` and `frontend`.
  - Add a `README.md` file to describe the project.

---

### **2. Backend Development**
#### **Task 1: Set Up Backend Framework**
- **Technical Considerations:**
  - Choose a Python framework (e.g., Flask or Django).
  - Install dependencies using `pip` and create a `requirements.txt` file.
  - Set up a basic server in `backend/app.py` (or equivalent).

#### **Task 2: Configure PostgreSQL Database**
- **Technical Considerations:**
  - Install PostgreSQL and set up a database.
  - Use an ORM (e.g., SQLAlchemy for Flask or Django's built-in ORM) to interact with the database.
  - Define a `Todo` model with fields like `id`, `title`, `description`, `completed`, and `created_at`.

#### **Task 3: Create RESTful APIs**
- **Technical Considerations:**
  - Implement CRUD APIs for to-do items:
    - `GET /todos`: Fetch all to-do items.
    - `POST /todos`: Create a new to-do item.
    - `PUT /todos/<id>`: Update a to-do item.
    - `DELETE /todos/<id>`: Delete a to-do item.
  - Use JSON for request/response data.

#### **Task 4: Test Backend APIs**
- **Technical Considerations:**
  - Use tools like Postman or `curl` to test the APIs.
  - Write unit tests for the backend using a testing framework (e.g., `pytest`).

---

### **3. Frontend Development**
#### **Task 1: Set Up React App**
- **Technical Considerations:**
  - Use `Create React App` or `Vite` to bootstrap the frontend.
  - Install necessary dependencies (e.g., `axios` for API calls, `react-router-dom` for routing).
  - Organize the folder structure:
    ```
    frontend/
    â”œâ”€â”€ public/
    â”œâ”€â”€ src/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.js
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
    â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
    â””â”€â”€ ...
    ```

#### **Task 2: Design Mobile-First UI**
- **Technical Considerations:**
  - Use a CSS framework like **Tailwind CSS** or **Material-UI** for responsive design.
  - Ensure the app is optimized for mobile devices (e.g., touch-friendly buttons, readable fonts).
  - Create reusable components (e.g., `TodoList`, `TodoItem`, `AddTodoForm`).

#### **Task 3: Connect Frontend to Backend**
- **Technical Considerations:**
  - Use `axios` to make API calls to the backend.
  - Fetch and display to-do items from the backend.
  - Implement functionality to add, update, and delete to-do items.

#### **Task 4: Test Frontend**
- **Technical Considerations:**
  - Test the UI on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
  - Use tools like **React Testing Library** for unit testing.

---

### **4. Integration and Deployment**
#### **Task 1: Integrate Backend and Frontend**
- **Technical Considerations:**
  - Ensure the frontend and backend communicate seamlessly.
  - Handle CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) if the frontend and backend are on different domains.

#### **Task 2: Deploy the App**
- **Technical Considerations:**
  - Backend: Deploy the Python backend on a platform like **Heroku**, **Render**, or **AWS**.
  - Frontend: Deploy the React app on **Netlify**, **Vercel**, or **GitHub Pages**.
  - Ensure the PostgreSQL database is hosted and accessible (e.g., using **ElephantSQL** or **AWS RDS**).

---

### **5. Documentation and Handover**
#### **Task 1: Write Documentation**
- **Technical Considerations:**
  - Document the setup process for both backend and frontend.
  - Include instructions for running the app locally and deploying it.

#### **Task 2: Handover and Review**
- **Technical Considerations:**
  - Share the GitHub repository with collaborators.
  - Conduct a code review to ensure best practices are followed.
